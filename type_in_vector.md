# C++ Vector Specialization: vector<int> vs. vector<bool>

This repository demonstrates and explains the key differences between the standard `std::vector<int>` and the **specialized** `std::vector<bool>` in C++.

## üßê What is `std::vector<bool>`?

`std::vector<bool>` is a **template specialization** of the `std::vector` class. Unlike all other standard containers (which store elements contiguously), `std::vector<bool>` is designed for **memory efficiency**.

### üíæ Memory Optimization (Bit Packing)

* A standard `bool` typically occupies **1 byte** of memory.
* `std::vector<bool>` 'packs' the boolean values so that each `bool` only occupies **1 bit** of memory. It stores up to 8 boolean values in a single byte. This is known as **bit packing**.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è The Major Drawback: Proxy Reference

Due to bit packing, individual elements are not stored at standard byte addresses. This means `std::vector<bool>` **cannot** return a true `bool&` (reference to a boolean) when you access an element, for example, using the subscript operator `v[i]`.

Instead, it returns a **proxy object** that looks and acts like a `bool&`, but is not a true reference.

| Operation | `vector<int>` | `vector<bool>` | Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Element Access** | Returns a true reference (`int&`) | Returns a **proxy object** | Violates the standard container requirement for a true reference. |
| **Address-of Operator** | `&v[i]` is **valid** | `&v[i]` is **invalid** (compile error/undefined behavior) | You cannot get a pointer to a bit. |

## üõ†Ô∏è When to Use

| Container | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`std::vector<int>`** | Standard usage for collections of integers. When **performance** (especially access speed) or getting **true references** is critical. |
| **`std::vector<bool>`** | When **memory usage** is the absolute highest priority, and you have a very large array of boolean values. Avoid if you need to pass element references to external functions. |

## Alternative to `std::vector<bool>`

If you need a container of booleans that **fully** satisfies the requirements of a standard C++ container (i.e., returns a true `bool&` on element access) but don't mind the 1-byte per element overhead, use a **`std::deque<bool>`** or a **`std::vector<char>`** (if you're using `char` for boolean representation).
